* Infrastructure setup
  * VPN config
  * [Redirector](redirector.md)
  * Beacon/agent profile config


The blog contains setup that will utilize the services of

* Cloudflare - to buy domain and get a certificate (if you want to test purely locally you must have a lot of VM opened/computer and have a powerdns)
* VPS for HTTP/HTTPS redirector
* 1 more Redirector - still checking if AWS, DO or azure serverless. 
* Another VPS but an OpenVPN for C2 server and client.
* 1 VM with C2 server hosted locally (should be isolated)
* 1 VM for C2 operator
* 1 Target machine hosted locally but ideally it would be great if it's on a different computer with VM, or AWS / azure windows VM (but the thing about those 2 you need to get a permission if you will test something related to that)
